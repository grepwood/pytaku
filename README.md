# Pytaku

Pytaku is for the moment an interactive command-line program that enables the user to retrieve direct links to anime episodes from places like Shinden.

# Purpose

The purpose of this software is to enable watching anime in groups on services that can stream from direct links to multiple users simultaneously, for example WatchTogether (w2g.tv).
It can also enable to user to download said anime episodes for offline watching, but that is an unavoidable side-effect of retrieving the links.
